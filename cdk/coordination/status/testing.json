Added comprehensive test coverage for handler system: (1) Handler Verification - Ed25519 signature verification, manifest validation, WASM module validation; (2) Handler Execution - basic execution, input/output validation, state management, error scenarios; (3) Sandbox Isolation - memory limits, CPU limits, filesystem isolation, network isolation; (4) Egress Control - allowlist validation, rate limiting, request validation, IP blocking; (5) First-Party Handlers - messaging (send text), profile updates, connection invites with business logic validation; (6) Registry API - list handlers with pagination/filtering/sorting, upload handler with versioning; (7) E2E Handler Lifecycle - complete install→execute→update→uninstall flow with state persistence. Tests use mock handler packages simulating WASM module behavior based on vault-manager architecture documentation."
