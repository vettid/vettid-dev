  "notes": "Phase 8 complete. Backup System UI fully implemented. Backup data models created with BackupListState, BackupDetailState, CredentialBackupState, CredentialRecoveryState enums. APIClient extended with backup management (triggerBackup, listBackups, restoreBackup, deleteBackup), backup settings (get/update), and credential backup endpoints (create, status, download, recover). BIP39WordList contains full 2048-word English wordlist with isValidWord(), getSuggestions(), and index() methods. RecoveryPhraseManager implements BIP-39 phrase generation with SHA-256 checksum, PBKDF2 key derivation (600K iterations, HMAC-SHA512), and ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption. BackupListView shows backup history with type badges and swipe-to-delete. BackupSettingsView provides auto-backup configuration with frequency picker and WiFi-only toggle. CredentialBackupView guides users through 24-word recovery phrase generation with verification challenge. CredentialRecoveryView features 3x8 word input grid with real-time BIP-39 validation and autocomplete suggestions. BackupBackgroundTask uses BGProcessingTask and NWPathMonitor for scheduled background backups. All views use iOS 16 compatible APIs.",
